# Kanban Board

Kanban board application ðŸš€

## Foundation

For the foundation I created some placeholder elements in html in order to syle the potential content of the page.

## Dark Mode and other themes

I created a dark mode, as well as a couple other color theme options for the user to interact with.

## UI

I allowed the user to add and delete tasks from each task list.

## Animations

I made the page load using animations to give the user more of a fun experience. I also used animation to make the interactive buttons pulsate.
